# Ruby components



## ICMUtil
tasks:
- contain variables for communicating with Infoworks

things I dont like:
- doing the getNetworkInfo and the complicated changeValues through strategies feels a bit weird, this could be done in the ScenarioManager class maybe

## DGInfoworks
tasks:
- initialize classes and call the necessary functions

## UICommunicator
tasks:
- write json file for ui
- read json file from ui


## Simulator
tasks:
- setup sccenariomanager
- setup initial scenarioname
- run the simulations
- export the simulations


## ScenarioManager
tasks: 
- apply changes as specified in scenariomanager
