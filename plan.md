# Desley's plan for finishing the thesis 
- coding
    - create a proper architecture on paper first, documenting the decisions and reasons for making them
    - decoupling in the backend
    - frontend: single responsibility principle
    - fix the bugs
- ui testing
    - write out manual test cases
    - run the tests myself
    - iterate design slightly based on results
    - testing by Revin if time allows it
- efficiency testing
    - graphs
    - (mention that the data is real (use big database Revin sent))
- Documentation
    - Elaborate the literature by reviewing synthetic data generation, scenario sampling strategies, and simulation software design (from a UI perspective).
    - Discussion part about: failure cases, future cases and limitations
    - justify decisions on software architecture 




# Sunday plan:
- consider opening a UI before running the program for selecting model and filepath
- consider marking fields in the UI
- add more style to the UI
