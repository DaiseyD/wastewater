# Desley's plan for finishing the thesis 
- coding
    - fix the bugs
    - implement the repeating strategy
    - add options in ui for limited exporting
- ui testing
    - write out manual test cases
    - run the tests myself
    - iterate design slightly based on results
    - testing by Revin if time allows it
- efficiency testing
    - graphs
    - (mention that the data is real (use big database Revin sent))
- Documentation
    - Elaborate the literature by reviewing synthetic data generation, scenario sampling strategies, and simulation software design (from a UI perspective).
    - Discussion part about: failure cases, future cases and limitations
    - justify decisions on software architecture 


# Desley's time management
## week 1 (29 september - 5 october)
finish coding completely so Revin can test UI

## week 2 (6 - 12 octoberr)
finish the rest of the coding and literature review

## week 3 (13-19 october)


## week 4 (20-26 october)
finish documentation and finishing touches

# Week 1 goals:
- Add a submit window which opens when you click submit to show you the full info of what you are about to submit, should also include a cancel button
- Redesign typewindow
 - add colours to know when things are selected
 - add buttons to filter by type
 - 
- find at least 1 program that handles data manipulation and base my design on theirs (powerBI, )



# Week 2 goals:
- finish the literature review and do not touch the code
- finish the skeleton for how the efficiency testing will be done, ask Revin for ui testing
- compile results from UI testing to improve code, document the UI testing results and how I will improve the UI based on that

# Week 3 goals
-
